Goldbach’s other conjecture
---------------------------

It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.

> 9 = 7 + 2×1<sup>2</sup><br/>
> 15 = 7 + 2×2<sup>2</sup><br/>
> 21 = 3 + 2×3<sup>2</sup><br/>
> 25 = 7 + 2×3<sup>2</sup><br/>
> 27 = 19 + 2×2<sup>2</sup><br/>
> 33 = 31 + 2×1<sup>2</sup>

It turns out that the conjecture was false.

What is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?
