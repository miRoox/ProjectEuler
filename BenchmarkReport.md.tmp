# Benchmark Report

My Project Euler solution programs were bench­marked to see how much time it took to compute the answer.
This information gives a rough sense of which problems are easy or hard, and how the choice of program­ming language affects the running time.

Note that the benchmark does *not* attempt to be “fair” in any way.
The time of the benchmark includes the (JIT) compile time and the start time of the interpreter.
The algorithms between different languages are not exactly the same.
And my solution code is not optimized for the fastest speed.

All the numbers listed in the table below are in seconds, and these computing environments were used:

> Windows 10 (Home Edition)
>
> Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz, 6 cores, 12 logical processors
>
> NVIDA GeForce GTX 1650

* Wolfram Mathematica 12.0 (64-bit)
* Julia 1.1.1 (64-bit)
